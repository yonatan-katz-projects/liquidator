## Liquidator bot for Aave crypto liquiduty protocol
In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi) and lending platforms like Aave, "liquidation" <br>
typically refers to the process of seizing and selling collateral to repay a loan when the borrower's position falls below a certain threshold,<br>
known as the liquidation threshold. </br>

Here's a basic overview of how liquidation works on platforms like Aave:</br>

## Borrowing with Collateral: 
When users borrow funds on Aave, they must provide collateral in the form of other cryptocurrencies.</br>
The collateral serves as security for the loan.

## Liquidation Threshold:
Aave sets a liquidation threshold for each asset. </br>
If the value of the collateral falls below this threshold due to market fluctuations, the position becomes vulnerable to liquidation.</br>

## Liquidation Process: 
If the collateralized position approaches or falls below the liquidation threshold,</br>
the Aave protocol may automatically liquidate a portion of the collateral to repay the outstanding loan. </br>
This involves selling the borrower's collateral on the open market.</br>

## Liquidation Incentives: 
To encourage users to monitor and maintain their collateralized positions, </br>
Aave often includes an incentive mechanism. </br>
Those who identify and liquidate risky positions may receive a portion of the liquidated collateral as a reward. </br>

## Auction Mechanism: 
In some cases, the liquidation process involves an auction where other users can bid for the collateral being sold. </br>
This auction mechanism helps to ensure a fair market price for the liquidated assets. </br>
